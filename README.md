OK!! Guess your here to use Gearing, so you need to learn about it.

So, first I'd advise you to add a proper HTML document to a project repo/folder, otherwise it might be a bit hard to run your code (apart if you're using some sort of code editor like CodePen or JSBin). So, it should be kinda like THIS:

```html
<!doctype HTML>

<html>
<head>

	<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.4.min.js"></script>
	<script src="https://aethergush"></script>
```
